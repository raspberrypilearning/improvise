## Set your solution’s goals
Now that you have identified the problem you want to solve and the users you want to solve it for, you should clearly state what the solution’s goals are. This is basically writing your to-do list for the design and building stages to follow.

While you should spend some time on this step — making sure that your list of goals creates a ‘complete’ solution to the problem with no gaps or missing features that make it unusable — it doesn’t have to solve everything at once. It is fine and, particularly in software development, normal for the first version of a product to only solve the problem for some people. Usually, this is the group that is easiest to solve the problem for, so the product can be given to those users and their feedback used to improve future versions. Once you have that feedback, come back here and repeat this step for version two!

Numerous articles, and even entire books, have been written about how to set goals for digital solutions to users’ problems. Once you’ve gotten comfortable with our method, you should look at some of them and see if one better suits your approach. There is no ‘right’ way to do this, but this one is relatively simple and has been successfully used for years.

### List your goals
Write a simple bullet-point list of your solution’s goals. These are just sentences that start with ‘The solution will…’.

  - Allow users to report busses that are not running
  - Allow users to report delayed busses
  - Allow users to find reports for their bus route
  - Help users find their route by using their location
  - Allow users to confirm an existing report
  - Help users understand how likely delays are on a route
  - Allow users to favourite bus routes they use regularly
  - Allow users to cancel a report they have made, if the bus does arrive
  - Help users to find alternative routes to their destination if they are delayed

### Break goals into priority groups
Next, you should break your goals into four groups to help you decide what order to tackle them in. It may also be helpful to number the goals within those groups, if you think some are more important than others. The four groups are:

Must
: These are features that the solution absolutely must have in order to solve the problem for the users you are targeting with this version. If one of these is missing, it just won’t work.

Should
: These are features that a user would probably expect the solution to have. The experience of using it will likely be worse if one or more of them are missing, but it will still work without any of them.

Would be nice to
: These are features that are not necessary to the solution but might be a pleasant surprise for users to find.

Future version will
: These are features that you have thought of, and plan to include in a future version of the solution. Usually, these are features that are large, complex, or require you to learn a new technical skill and would be better served by being the focus of their own future version rather than something you try to add before you feel ready to share the current one. One of the main reasons to list them when planning this version is to be sure that you don’t make design decisions that will significantly increase the difficulty of adding these features later.
