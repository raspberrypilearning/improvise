## Define the problem

The first stage in creating a solution to address a user need is to clearly define what that need is. This could start off as a single sentence, but should grow into a paragraph, or a list of relevant facts about the problem.

To do this well, you should research the problem to understand it and identify the key issues you want to focus on solving. Don’t just rely on your own understanding: look for news articles, briefings from organisations, even academic research if it’s appropriate to the problem. Be conscious of the fact that such sources will contain the biases of their authors and make sure to consider several perspectives rather than simply reflecting the first one you find.

It’s important to keep coming back to your problem statement to check that your project is going to help people solve it. You might even need to redefine your problem a little after you’ve worked through the next step and investigated your users.

  - Buses in my city can have long gaps between them and are sometimes cancelled or delayed with no notice, potentially leaving  people waiting at bus stops in harsh weather. 
  - It can take up to an hour following the scheduled departure time for the bus company to inform passengers that the bus is not coming, even though there is a ‘real-time’ bus information app. However, passengers at the first stop of the route can be relatively certain that the bus is cancelled within a few minutes. 
  - The real-time information provided by the bus company also fails to take account of traffic — estimates for arrival time are based only on the distance from the bus to a stop.
  - If passengers early on the route, or already on the bus, could somehow share this information with those waiting at later stops, later passengers could make alternative arrangements (e.g. taking a train) or at least return to shelter while they waited.
