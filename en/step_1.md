## Introduction

This project is a bit different: it walks you through the steps of clearly defining a problem and desiging a solution to it using the technical skills you have gained from the other projects on this site. The focus is on scoping, desiging, and testing your solution, it doesn't actually discuss how to build it!

If you've already completed a number of our projects, or are otherwise confident in your technical skills, then this is a project you can do over and over again, choosing a different problem to tackle each time. 

### What you will make
Whatever you want!
