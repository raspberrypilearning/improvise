## Build your solution
You have goals, you have a design to achieve those goals that you’ve tested with prospective users… you’re ready to build your solution! So get building!

When you’re creating your solution, remember the way you broke your goals up. Focus on getting the ‘must’ goals completed before starting on the ‘should’ goals and then moving on to the ‘would be nice’ ones. This ensures that, if you’re working to some sort of a deadline — for example a competition entry date — you’ll have the core of your solution working as soon as possible and you’ll just be working on adding extras. Which means you’ll have something that’s ready to demo or release even as you’re still adding features.
