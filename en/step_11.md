## Release your solution
Share your project with the target audience somehow (website/app store/GitHub etc.). Share your learnings with the maker community (blog/YouTube/forum post).

Once you’re happy with what you’ve created, share it with your intended audience of users. There are lots of ways to do this, depending on what you’ve created. You can share it with friends and family, publish software on GitHub, create a website where users can learn about and get your solution, submit it to relevant app stores, competitions, etc.

You can also create things like YouTube videos, blog posts, or other explanations of either how you created your solution — to give back to the maker community — or how your solution solves a problem or meets a need — to help promote it to the users it could help.
