## Generate ideas
Now that you know what your solution’s goals are, it’s time to decide what form your solution should take to achieve those goals. At this point, don’t worry about what technologies and tools you’re going to use to build the solution, just try to think of as many forms for the solution as you can. You may end up borrowing ideas from several of them for your final design.

You can write the ideas down as a list, sketch out quick pictures of them, put them on post-it notes and stick them to a wall, whatever works for you! Once you’ve got at least three ideas, site back and reflect on what makes each one good, or bad — including whether or not you have the skills to make it — and then choose your favourite. See if you can come up with ways to combine the strengths of any of your other ideas into that one.

It’s ok if you can’t pick your favourite just yet. You can take more than one idea through the next few stages before you have to commit to something.

At this point, you may also want to go back and adjust some of your goals to include ideas you’ve come up with!

#### Initial ideas
  - Smartphone app
  - Website
  - Kiosk/sign installed at/near bus stops
  - Text message based service that texts me if my bus is running late/cancelled
  - Speech recognising phone service I can call to make / get a report


#### Final selection
A website, aimed at smartphone screens, that will eventually support push notifications telling me about my regular bus route.
