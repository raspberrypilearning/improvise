## Empathise with your users
Now that you know the problem you’re trying to solve, you need to decide who you’re trying to solve it for. It’s important to empathise with your user: put yourself in their shoes and try to understand their wants and needs, as well as what they don’t want your solution to do.


These are the users your solution and you need to think about a number of key characteristics for them. While the specific characteristics that matter will vary based on the problem you are trying to solve, the following are usually worth considering:

  - Familiarity with technology: How easy will they find it to use a solution built on digital technology? Will they recognise common design elements, such as the ‘hamburger’ menu icon? Will they know that a bird symbol refers to Twitter, or a ghost to Snapchat?
  - What they already have: If a significant proportion of your target users already have smartphones, tablets, desktop computers, smart homes, or any other form of technology, you can decide to make that a part of your user definition and rely on that technology as part of your solution’s design.
  - Economic means: How much will a member of your target user group realistically be willing or able to spend to solve this problem? This can help you understand things like how much your components can cost or, in the case of a humanitarian issue, whether you also need to consider how your solution could appeal to a partner organisation that could help cover the costs of delivering it.
  - Access: Do your users have any access needs you should consider? They almost always do! For example: choosing colours that will make things easier for those who are colourblind; or avoiding a reliance on having quick reactions,  pressing small buttons, or making complex gestures, that may be difficult for users for a variety of reasons.

As you are creating this profile, it’s important to think about what you don’t know about your users but want to. You can then use tools like research, interviews with friends and family, or online surveys, to find the answers to those questions. There are a few open-ended interview or survey questions that are almost always worth asking:

  - Please describe the problem in your own words
  - What do you need my solution to do for you?
  - What else would you like my solution to do for you?
  - What might my solution do that you wouldn’t want it to?

My users are people who:

  - Live in, or are visiting, my city
  - Rely on the bus as part of their transport solution
  - Are likely to want to change their travel plans as a result of delays — so people on deadlines, or with alternative public transport routes available to them.
  - Are likely to want to seek shelter in the event of bad weather while waiting for a delayed bus — people who don’t have shelters at or near their bus stop.
  - Are not tech experts, but are familiar with common phone app and website design norms

In addition to the standard interview questions listed above, I don’t know some things about my users, and will discover them through research and interview:

  - How far do they usually live from their bus stop? — This might help me decide how soon I need to alert them of delays.
  - Do they usually use the same handful of bus routes? — This could help me decide whether to add a favourting feature.
