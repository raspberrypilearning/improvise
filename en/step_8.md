## Test your design
Once you’ve built your prototype, you should find some potential users, maybe friends or family, who are in your target user group and ask them to try ‘using’ it. Tell them what it’s supposed to do 
for them, but don’t tell them how it’s supposed to work!

You’ll have to move pages around, or explain what the solution will do in response to their interaction, but it can be very useful to see what users will try to do when given your design without any instruction from you.

Take notes on what worked as you expected and where the user struggled, then use them to update your designs. Note down anything that they thought was missing, and consider whether you need to add a goal for that in this version, whether it should be part of a future version, or whether it doesn’t fit with your design.
