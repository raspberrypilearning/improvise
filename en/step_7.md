## Make a prototype
Once you have a design you like, you should construct a prototype of that design. This is a sort of model, or mock, version of the finished solution that will let you test particular elements that you want to ensure you get right. You can create multiple prototypes to test different elements of the design, or improvements made to your design based on feedback from earlier prototypes.

If you’re designing something with an electronic circuit, you should prototype the circuit on a breadboard before reaching for a soldering iron.

If you are creating a case or physical interface for a hardware project, you can construct a prototype out of cardboard, or lego, in order to check that you’re happy with the layout.

For a web page or phone app, you can either use a collection of design drawings, or put them together in a program like Google Slides, to make them easy to click between.
